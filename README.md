# Hackfest 2k22

<b>Our Idea : </b>
<p>We have created a platform where citizens would be able to upload the medicine's name they don't need anymore and then those medicines would be collected and re-distributed among needy people. Our application aims to reduce the medical wastage happening all over India by creating a simpler and easier way of communication between the citizens and the NGO's. This will also cut-off the demands of medicines and hence the cost.</p>

<i>Some Background Knowledge: </i>
<i> India's concern over medicine is a huge issue. India generated 56,898 tonnes of Covid-19 bio-medical waste between June 2020 and June 2021. Nowadays, medicines are getting costlier and not everyone can afford them. So instead of dumping the remaining medicines, it can be re-distributed(If not expired) to the people who need those Medicines. Such tasks are carried out by several NGO's but many citizens are still not aware of these and NGO's also lack a systematic way of collecting and redistributing medicines. </i>

<h1> Our Back-End :</h1>
<p>
On the Backend part, we have created the database schema of the user and the medicine, also we have created various routes for login, registration, and donor form  filling, also we had setup nodemailer in the website to use as a mailing system these routes has been linked to the frontend of the website and hence the website works integratively.
<br/>
  We have also enabled the data extraction through picture of medicine using Open-CV.
